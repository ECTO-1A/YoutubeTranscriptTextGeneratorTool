2462.359,very thrilled to introduce Manish to you
2464.52,he also is uh dedicating himself double
2467.4,duty today he's going to be doing a um
2471.0,Round Table discussion this afternoon
2472.64,we're going to have three different
2473.88,discussions at 3 pm right after the
2476.88,panel at 2 pm in the meantime Welcome to
2479.76,our let's give a warm welcome to our
2481.48,first Speaker
2485.2,unish hi everybody um I like to not
2488.599,stand at the podium can you all hear me
2491.079,okay yes okay in the back though really
2494.119,can you hear me okay all right all right
2496.359,you can give me the wobbly head if not
2497.839,you be like man I can't hear you all
2499.52,right so very excited to be here I've
2502.8,been thinking about giving this talk for
2506.88,years and you know usually I don't know
2509.56,if you submit talks when you submit
2511.56,talks yeah if you don't speak into the
2513.96,mic ah they can't record ah okay here I
2517.4,am at the podium so
2519.04,boring we're at every other conference
2521.48,now um so I've been thinking about
2524.16,giving this talk for years
2526.119,because
2528.359,uh I I've had some really tough times
2532.04,I've learned some hard lessons and I
2534.92,felt like if I kept those to myself
2537.359,other people are learning those hard
2538.72,lessons on their own I don't say that
2541.559,with you know great pride I say with a
2544.2,lot of humility let me try and save
2546.28,people some pain
2547.68,every time I experience one of those I
2549.119,think Yep this is going to go in the
2550.44,talk so you are getting the first
2553.04,unvarnished version of this talk which
2555.64,is as much
2557.72,about the title of the talk how to
2559.92,succeed in a role that didn't exist as
2562.0,it is me trying to distill some
2564.0,hard-earned lessons from Mostly failures
2568.76,this is a talk mostly about distillation
2571.4,of failures and it is really about
2574.079,resilience besides is the place I wanted
2576.64,to do it
2578.04,because this conference is about
2579.8,Community is about learning from each
2581.96,other and in effect is very much about
2586.319,this kind of resilience this kind of
2587.839,Storytelling so the first thing
2590.92,is who am I um when I think about it's
2595.44,such a like existential question who are
2597.16,you what do you do what have you
2600.8,done why are you here those are all like
2604.559,big existential questions but I'm going
2606.559,to try and answer answer those for
2609.04,you I'm going to answer them in reverse
2611.359,order because the I don't know why I'm
2613.88,here really or who I am but I'll tell
2616.24,you what I've
2618.28,done I've worked in a lot of different
2621.0,domains of trying to help people and
2623.28,organizations understand
2625.88,uncertainty that's what I've done done a
2629.04,lot of different domains terrorism fraud
2631.24,geopolitics cyber investigations
2633.28,critical infrastructure supply chain I
2635.319,don't say that with bragado doio I say
2636.839,that like it spans a variety I've worked
2638.64,on nuclear policy a lot of different
2640.52,areas which means I've been new a
2643.119,lot new to an industry new to a field
2649.359,unproven I'm here because as I said
2652.28,before I really want to share these
2654.96,hard-earned lessons with you in a way
2658.079,that I hope is very actionable for you
2660.28,either today or someday
2664.92,soon so who am I one of you I'm someone
2668.599,who is focused on community uh which is
2673.76,I assume why you all are here too I'm
2675.92,someone who cares about people I'm a
2679.2,relational
2680.24,person thank you
2683.4,and I'm someone who has only
2687.0,succeeded because other people have
2689.44,helped
2690.2,me all those domains I talked about I'm
2692.8,not experts in those
2694.76,domains and I entered into them not as
2697.119,experts the only reason I was able to do
2699.599,those jobs the only reason I was able to
2700.92,do a role that didn't exist before is
2703.64,because the community of people around
2705.119,me that I kind of joke but not really
2708.44,I'm not smart I know smart
2715.559,people let's see if I can do
2718.76,this okay all
2720.96,right yes maybe no okay no worries yes
2724.72,haha all right so here's what we're
2726.48,going to cover
2728.72,what does it mean to have a new role I
2731.64,want to Define that very clearly and how
2733.559,do you identify it if you're
2735.359,interviewing for it or you might be in
2737.599,one and not even recognize that it's a
2739.28,new role second what are the likely
2741.92,pitfalls how do you manage those that's
2743.599,where I want to spend the bulk of the
2744.88,time and then what you must do early and
2748.96,how to learn quickly the end of this is
2752.319,unless you want to go through a very
2754.8,painful experience like I have multiple
2757.88,times that's the dott dot dot that
2759.8,follows this so that is those are some
2763.48,core things and I'm not going to hide
2765.8,this I'm not one of those people that
2766.72,puts all the beautiful stuff and
2767.92,wonderful stuff at the end like all this
2769.44,is going to be pretty much up
2771.48,front so let's talk about what it means
2774.359,to have a new
2777.8,role um this is pretty I think I mean
2782.2,it's always true in technology and
2784.8,perhaps in cyber that there's something
2786.559,new
2788.2,but does it not feel like we're on the
2790.2,cusp of another new moment where there's
2792.68,going to be a bunch of newly minted AI
2795.44,experts right there's going to be a
2797.119,bunch of new roles I don't say that
2798.68,being glib how many of you have seen
2800.96,those
2802.359,postings how many of you have been
2804.0,tempted to apply for those
2805.559,roles yeah where you're like yeah man
2808.559,I'm an AI security person you
2812.2,bet so the first is you know what does
2815.76,it mean to have a new role and how to
2817.24,identify
2818.44,it so I think the big are you getting a
2821.28,move ahead no okay just my mind all
2824.0,right here we go this is my favorite
2828.52,photo uh so lots of times you know it's
2832.64,like I think about this phrase
2835.96,unicorn unicorn something that puts it
2838.359,all together HR and recruit PE recruiter
2841.16,folks will sometimes call it the purple
2842.52,squirrel you ever heard that term
2845.52,before this is a a term that HR and
2848.359,recruiter folks use to describe you know
2851.52,all those bullets they know that they
2854.0,can't find somebody that has all those
2856.559,bullets they're not designing for that
2858.92,person they're designing for someone
2860.76,approximate that that's a purple
2861.88,squirrel unicorn so this to me is the
2865.119,like oh no I I understand machine
2867.8,learning and models boom I'm an AI
2870.0,person
2871.24,now
2872.96,and I think this isn't totally
2876.2,inaccurate but there is sometimes a
2879.559,moment where that didn't exist before so
2884.4,how do you genuinely figure out if it
2885.88,didn't exist before versus it's just an
2888.24,evolution of something there's three
2890.04,things I think about first where is that
2893.16,organization in its maturity that
2895.64,doesn't mean the organization itself has
2897.599,to be mature that means where is the
2900.16,organization in its maturity so it could
2903.96,be a Fortune 500 company but is finally
2906.92,the place where it's recognizing the
2908.599,need for
2909.88,something it very often people think new
2913.04,roles are at new
2914.359,companies I don't think that's
2916.359,necessarily
2917.92,true at a at a startup I've worked at
2920.16,multiple startups at a startup there's a
2921.559,tendency to be like every R is new no
2922.92,one's ever had this before yeah well at
2924.28,that company sure because it's a new
2925.559,company but does anyone have this so the
2928.64,second thing is to figure out what is it
2930.2,at the intersection of almost always
2933.079,guaranteed it's an intersection of at
2934.44,least two sometimes three things
2938.76,and the third I'll get to this a little
2940.2,bit more is you are going to ask the
2943.0,question need to ask the question and
2944.92,seek the answer why didn't this exist
2947.839,before why is it being created
2951.04,now what prompted that there's a lot of
2954.72,questions underneath that but that
2955.96,question over and over and over so the
2958.92,the other title of this talk but I
2961.079,wasn't sure that it would make it
2962.92,through the review board because it was
2964.96,oh a little too Goofy
2968.4,was becoming a pirate
2970.92,unicorn because that's how I think about
2973.079,new
2975.04,roles uh a pirate
2977.799,unicorn supposes that there's a world of
2980.48,unicorns there are so many unicorns that
2982.839,there can actually be a pirate
2985.76,unicorn thank you here are all the
2988.88,images of pirate unicorn that I
2991.359,love uh the middle one I think might be
2993.799,my favorite but I also like the be who
2996.72,you
2998.799,are uh so the the idea behind the pirate
3002.52,unicorn which is what I've kind of
3004.119,coined this new role like truly new role
3008.96,is it's fun it's exciting it's also a
3013.44,threat some people will see it the same
3016.28,way they viewed Pirates not cool but
3018.68,like they're here to steal your
3020.96,[ __ ] and they're going to use gorilla
3023.0,tactics to do
3025.319,it uh and shouldn't trust
3028.839,you because you're going to take
3030.68,something from it and so I like the idea
3033.559,of putting these two images
3036.359,together also at the very end of there's
3038.76,time tell you another kind of funny not
3041.079,really funny not haha funny but like
3043.119,let's drink funny a story about pirate
3045.52,unicorn all right so I don't want to
3048.0,spend too much time on this but let's
3050.119,talk
3052.359,briefly what are the pros and cons of
3055.799,the pirate univers corn I would like
3058.52,this to be a bit interactive if we can
3061.319,even though I'm up here talking at you
3063.48,so I want you to take a minute 30
3065.799,seconds just think of one thing that you
3068.599,think is great about being the pirate
3070.559,unicorn and one thing that sucks about
3073.079,being the pirate
3074.96,unicorn so just raise your hand I'm
3076.839,going to call on you yell it out and
3078.48,I'll repeat
3080.2,yes you don't know what you don't know
3082.52,is that a pro or a
3085.079,con someone said
3087.16,yes I agree yes you don't know what you
3089.88,don't know okay yes you're special
3093.799,you're only you're special and you're
3096.76,the only one pro or
3100.0,con
3101.76,only great special is pro you're the
3106.72,only one con there's no one to learn
3109.44,from I'll put a caveat on that there's
3111.799,no one to learn from there's no one to
3113.4,learn from at your
3115.52,organization which is why this
3118.559,matters this matters because there's
3121.599,other pirate unicorns out there all
3123.359,right any others yeah there's wide open
3127.079,in front of you you have no idea any of
3131.559,yes okay so there's wide open space in
3133.2,front of you but you don't really know
3134.68,where the boundaries are I will cavey
3136.92,out a little bit or add a little bit and
3138.319,say it looks wide open to
3140.92,you but it's claimed by everybody else
3144.04,you're like look at all this open space
3145.72,everyone's like who's who's that King
3147.119,running through our yard you're like
3150.2,it's me the pirate unicorn Galloping
3152.52,beautifully okay one more
3156.39,[Music]
3162.2,yes okay this person could give this
3165.04,talk um they said you the pros you can
3169.88,lead the way con is you have to explain
3172.2,to everyone why you're
3173.839,there so that's my talk basically there
3176.839,it is yay thank you all right enjoy the
3178.76,rest um so here that thank you yeah it
3181.48,was brief to the point okay so here's
3184.2,sort of distilled what's awesome what's
3187.28,terrible so what's awesome you're
3188.799,Innovative by your very
3190.72,existence oh my gosh you're new how
3192.88,Innovative like this wasn't here before
3194.72,so anything you do is innovative by
3196.68,virtue of the fact that it has not been
3197.96,done before I say that a little bit glib
3199.72,okay very GLI but you get my
3201.88,point you're ready to partner with
3204.4,everybody everybody's maybe ready to
3207.04,partner with you question mark but
3208.4,you're like yes totally I'll work with
3210.4,you absolutely I'd love to come learn
3212.24,about your team I'd love to tell you
3214.48,what I do as soon as I figure it out
3216.119,like you're just none of those
3217.64,boundaries are really there it's
3219.52,impossible to
3223.16,fail no one knows what failure looks
3225.2,like no one knows what success looks
3226.839,like so what's terrible you know nothing
3229.319,and no one cares I'm being very this
3232.68,comes from a darker place just maybe
3235.079,like two days ago but but the point is
3238.04,that you you don't know what you don't
3240.24,know and even including sometimes your
3245.0,boss no one
3247.599,really is set up to be like I'm going to
3250.0,help you succeed because it's going to
3251.24,help me succeed like you're lucky if you
3253.76,come in with that but most times people
3255.92,are like
3258.52,okay no one knows who needs you and why
3261.44,this is really important this is really
3263.799,crucial I'll come back to this later but
3266.119,one of your most important tasks is to
3268.599,figure out who are your internal
3270.4,customers that's a very corporate way of
3272.72,saying who needs you and who do you
3278.119,need I would argue that in the first 90
3280.72,days you should have a very clear map of
3282.76,that you develop hypothesis you test
3285.68,them you talk to people you roll out
3288.559,different products ideas you float
3290.76,things you see ah yes that person needed
3292.92,it oh no that person it didn't change
3294.88,anything
3296.76,that person is saying things that I know
3298.52,that I'm going to do without me having
3300.16,asked them prompted them they need
3304.0,me and why so the good thing here is
3309.28,that I would argue that the second
3311.52,bullet is really crucial for security
3313.359,and risk folks generally you should
3315.88,generally be doing
3317.68,this but in this role you have to
3321.76,otherwise you're just going to
3323.24,float you're not going to fail it's
3325.44,going to be worse you're going to
3328.76,float and it's impossible to succeed
3332.0,because no one has done it
3334.44,before so class half full half empty
3337.68,some people are going to be like sky's
3340.039,the limit try anything and other people
3342.359,are going to be like yeah no one
3343.52,succeeded in that
3346.839,before uh can you remind me this talk is
3349.28,being recorded yes okay so uh I want to
3353.92,share some stories but I need to
3355.4,sanitize them appro
3356.839,I worked at a large
3359.28,organization and at that large
3362.599,organization um it had been around
3365.599,for a couple hundred
3368.64,years and the group that I was in had
3372.4,been around for this many it was this
3375.079,many years
3376.64,old when I showed
3379.559,up
3382.559,and my organization within that larger
3385.799,structure
3386.799,was already the pirate
3390.48,unicorn and I was I don't know the
3392.76,pirate unicorn on the pirate unicorn I
3394.44,don't know the metaphor breaks down it
3396.88,it was really challenging to come in
3399.48,because that was new I was doing cyber
3404.119,risk and cyber defense for a city
3407.359,government this was at a time when
3409.359,people were like huh like what Municipal
3411.52,cyber security why would you why would
3414.119,you be doing that like are we paying for
3416.599,that aren taxes paying for that like
3418.2,shouldn't we be spending more on the
3419.52,fire department or whatever
3422.119,else so there is a lot more in the
3425.319,what's awesome and what's terrible and I
3427.52,don't mean to be I do mean to be why am
3430.16,I even saying that I do mean to be a
3431.48,little glib about the what's awesome
3434.16,because it's going to be
3437.079,shiny and it's going to draw you to it
3439.44,so here I'm trying to pun intended
3441.68,ground you on the things that you might
3443.68,not realize later
3446.359,okay next piece
3449.079,is in nature generally speaking there
3453.92,are some exceptions I am not a biologist
3456.72,but I did read about this a little bit
3458.52,out of curiosity and then in preparation
3460.4,for this talk about how environments in
3464.4,nature respond to a new
3470.16,species
3471.799,and there's three General ways
3477.4,first is is some kind of
3480.24,threat
3482.599,predatory second is not predatory but
3489.359,displacement and the third is
3493.079,additive in my totally non-scientific
3496.839,review of like you know some of the
3500.24,research around this I didn't read
3501.599,papers I read like case studies things
3503.039,that I could access with a little bit of
3505.72,gener AI to
3507.68,help a majority were the first
3511.119,two predatory threat or displacement
3516.28,read invasive invasive
3519.119,species so maybe
3521.359,they didn't you know uh take away
3524.68,something on the food chain but they
3526.24,displaced a bunch of space or something
3529.839,else so most environments view new as
3533.92,threats
3537.119,like we kind of valorize the
3540.96,pirate but if you're a shipping person
3544.52,like piracy is a huge huge problem for
3547.68,you they're taking away your hard-earned
3551.28,goods and currency right there's nothing
3555.039,sexy about
3556.96,it and so I say that with the
3559.599,calibration that you might be brought
3561.52,into a new role wait for it right after
3564.079,that company has done layoffs
3568.039,right when someone was told we don't
3570.2,have a budget for
3572.88,that right after the initiative that
3576.079,they've been trying to put forward as a
3578.48,new evolutionary initiative not even
3581.64,revolutionary new evolutionary
3583.68,initiative they were told yeah we just
3586.44,we don't have the support the real
3587.88,appetite to do something new right
3590.4,now and then the pirate unicorn shows up
3597.039,without knowing or needing to know
3599.839,anything about you or caring about
3602.799,you that person you can understand from
3605.64,a place of empathy is going to view you
3608.4,either as a threat or as an invasive
3613.24,species so personally the way I've dealt
3616.359,with this is two ways the first I call
3620.52,it
3622.039,out and I will talk to you in a little
3624.76,bit about how to get the information so
3627.96,that you can put it forward in a way
3630.44,that is
3631.88,acceptable because I also tell you from
3634.52,a place of learning that I've tried to
3636.0,be self-effacing and people are like
3637.52,look at this dude thinking he's like the
3640.839,best and thinking that he knows our
3642.44,organization he just showed up so I'll
3645.24,give you kind of that more but the
3647.319,second way always always always with
3650.359,humor always always always for me with
3653.64,humor so I make light of the fact that
3658.039,my title is new and didn't exist or is
3660.64,really long or what is it before uh that
3665.24,no one did this before and I used to
3668.24,make jokes about AI now I can't because
3670.28,it's actually happening um I would make
3673.599,jokes that I was like half a robot I was
3675.16,like a prototype like I would just
3676.599,stupid stuff but to let people know that
3679.44,I knew that I was new pun intended new
3683.48,um at one of the organizations I was was
3688.319,at not only so here's the the question
3692.4,that you need to keep in mind when
3693.68,you're having conversations meeting
3696.359,people we didn't need you before why do
3698.799,we need you
3700.359,now we didn't need you before why do we
3703.039,need you now by the way that loaded
3708.079,statement is not limited to roles I'm
3710.359,going to digress a little bit here most
3712.52,recently I've worked in software supply
3714.079,chain security software supply chain
3717.24,security we didn't need that before why
3719.2,do we need it now we just like secure
3721.16,what developers
3723.16,do right like you can take almost
3725.319,anything zero trust like what AI
3728.4,security we didn't need it before like
3729.599,what you could take any relatively new
3731.72,thing that's been there in cyber
3734.039,security and then you're kind of caught
3736.0,on the back foot because you're
3737.44,explaining what is the consequence of
3739.079,not having it which is very difficult
3741.359,place to be
3742.599,counterfactually so I'm queuing
3744.24,something up here which is like all
3745.2,right man what do we say come back
3747.359,around to that but the most important
3749.599,orienting thing even if you get
3752.559,introduced with a bunch of fanfair and a
3754.559,press release and I have gotten the
3757.4,introduction from the CEO to the
3759.839,executive
3761.0,team check out this new role
3763.81,[Music]
3766.76,Tada there still is most of the time
3769.599,it's going to be one of those two
3771.4,predatory
3773.039,invasive and it's unconscious
3777.559,and oh by the way it does not help if
3780.279,you're an underrepresented
3783.44,group there have been zero out of five
3787.039,times that I've done this where people
3789.359,like cool a person of color in this
3791.88,role to go back to the pirate unicorn
3794.599,like if we somehow figured out that the
3796.039,pirate unicorn was gay someone would be
3798.359,like oh man the gays are everywhere you
3801.039,know like it's like that comes in
3804.079,unconsciously
3806.16,that I got the role because I'm
3809.0,underrepresented because I'm
3810.92,different or and I've had people
3813.079,intimate this like be explicit about it
3817.0,oh they had to create a role for you and
3819.68,I always respond one way yeah the other
3822.92,ones weren't hard
3825.2,enough that's why they had to create a
3827.0,new one remember I said at the beginning
3829.0,it's going to be the Nexus of two maybe
3830.64,three
3832.0,things so now let's talk about really a
3834.76,new role why new R is created who
3837.24,creates them this is
3839.72,crucial I would argue again that
3841.68,security and RIS F should be doing this
3843.359,thinking about the organization Dynamics
3846.279,politics and organizational Capital so
3849.24,why are new roles created a couple
3851.119,different reasons lots of times
3853.88,somebody's like yeah let's bring that
3855.799,person in they're creating an around a
3858.559,person which you would think is pretty
3860.279,cool and it is it can be but the
3862.96,challenge is the scaffolding is built
3864.559,around that individual or go when they
3866.599,step away it sort of collapses around
3868.319,them or people don't see the
3869.599,architectural design they just see it as
3871.359,like built around the profile of who
3873.279,that
3874.119,is so who creates
3876.92,them this is important I'm going to jump
3879.64,around a little bit these questions
3881.039,aren't totally linear so what prompted
3883.079,it why now who sponsored has the
3884.72,organization done this before there's a
3886.92,few slides in here I think he's going to
3888.799,be put a few slides in here that if you
3890.24,either have this role or you think you
3891.68,might be looking at this role this is
3893.16,one of them take this
3896.16,these questions are ones that you need
3899.079,to figure
3900.119,out if you want to go into that role
3902.68,eyes wide open if you want to jump in
3905.119,figure it out as you you go cool good
3908.2,luck pirate
3909.839,unicor but if you try and search some of
3912.92,the answers to these and this can happen
3914.96,in interviews it can happen in uh
3917.52,talking with people who have left the
3918.839,organization talking people at similar
3921.2,organizations so the one question I ask
3923.4,in interview it's kind of like a
3924.68,two-part question and this is early on
3927.48,when I get like the screening call
3929.119,Opportunity or that's the official
3931.119,pathway unofficial pathway someone's
3932.44,like Hey we're thinking about doing this
3933.52,do you want to like I think you might be
3936.4,right for
3937.4,this I ask two questions join together
3941.52,it's that middle one what prompted this
3943.48,and why
3945.559,now so that reveals a lot it tells you
3949.2,how much they've thought about it it
3950.559,tells you what are the pain points that
3951.839,are coming in in advance and why now
3955.68,what is this moment what has
3958.44,happened because guaranteed how many of
3961.48,you have tried to hire someone before
3963.119,tried to get headcount right try and get
3965.24,headcount to hire someone you got to
3968.039,line everything up right and it's like
3971.44,now now it didn't work now no now and so
3976.76,at large
3978.359,organizations this is the last one who
3980.799,sponsored it someone likely multiple
3984.48,people have spent organizational and
3986.68,political Capital to get that
3989.559,role to get that role created to create
3993.0,space for it to justify it if there's a
3996.079,job description to put it out there all
3997.92,of that figuring out who that is and why
4002.319,they did it is critical to your early
4006.319,success first go find them and introduce
4009.319,yourself I know that sounds silly
4011.359,because you're like of course I'm going
4012.359,to know them of course I'm going to know
4013.72,you're there no hard Lon I learned here
4016.88,I assumed that everybody that I had
4018.279,interacted with had already had the
4020.72,introduction as to why I'm here or that
4024.0,senior person had design designed or
4027.2,decided this so in the next role that I
4029.72,did that in I again with humility it's
4034.279,one of the key things I'm going to say
4035.88,humility and humor are going to get you
4037.76,a long way as a pirate
4039.72,unicorn so with humility I went to
4043.2,people and said oh so I I I was talking
4046.68,to and I understood this is why they and
4050.039,sometimes they just say it they needed
4051.4,to build a threat intelligence
4052.72,capability that had this
4054.88,function and that's the experience that
4056.88,I
4058.4,have in one role um it was I didn't have
4063.48,as much cyber experience as I knew that
4066.92,as I assumed that they would
4069.0,need in that particular domain I was
4072.44,upfront with that all the way across I
4073.839,was like I not done 10 years of cloud
4076.359,security
4078.599,implementation or like managed hundreds
4082.88,of thousands of end points I've not done
4085.839,that and this is one of those times that
4087.839,it reinforced I'm saying this to you
4089.279,with humility that being very open about
4091.119,my experience was crucial because
4093.039,they're like good yeah we're not looking
4094.079,for that I said okay well here's how I
4097.359,would approach this role I'm veering a
4099.159,little bit here into the interview
4101.08,process but it comes back around to this
4104.08,because that's how learned how the role
4106.279,came to be said here's how I had
4107.64,approached this role I was that was
4109.64,basically the interview how would you do
4112.0,this well I think about it this way and
4114.279,I think I would do this first um these
4117.199,are the Frameworks that I would be
4118.56,drawing from these are the disciplines
4120.12,that I'm coming
4123.0,from and then okay fast forward got the
4127.839,job yay I learned that the person who
4132.199,had really pushed for that role was not
4134.6,in these conversations
4135.96,not in the interview process and had a
4138.279,completely different
4139.96,reason very valid one completely
4142.12,different reason for advocating for this
4144.64,so going to
4146.44,them when I found out who it was and I
4148.88,went to them I was going to be like I'm
4150.44,here like the person you were thinking
4152.719,of it's me thank you so much and they
4155.44,were like
4157.159,you were not what I was
4159.6,expecting that's what they
4162.0,said uh the pause was a little longer
4166.199,um and I said oh tell me more well I'm
4169.88,here now like tell me why and I
4172.279,basically got the story of why they push
4174.6,for the creation of this
4176.12,role and it was very different than what
4179.64,I was told and
4181.159,sold so a little bit of a orange flag
4184.64,went off not yellow flag not red flag
4186.96,orange flag like under
4189.92,construction and I got to explore that a
4192.08,little bit and then more informed as I
4194.12,went there so
4196.12,what prompted it why now who sponsored
4198.84,it has the organization done this before
4201.48,that's the other thing does the
4202.96,organization do this a lot do they
4205.12,create roles a
4207.44,lot do they create new roles are
4210.6,they spawning pirate unicorns all the
4213.8,time that's not a good thing or a bad
4215.92,thing but it is a telling
4218.52,thing if they do it a lot they better be
4221.6,good at
4222.679,it helping you succeed helping you
4225.0,figure out out who to talk to giving you
4227.4,some sort of here's what's new here's
4228.76,what's
4229.76,not okay our uh vaunted audience member
4233.44,over here talked about something needing
4235.679,to explain what you do here is a tenant
4239.12,I try and basically live
4242.679,by tell your story or someone else
4246.48,will why are you here remember invasive
4249.719,species that's the
4253.159,default you need to show and explain and
4256.88,demonstrate probably repeatedly that you
4259.48,are there as an additive part of the
4261.92,ecosystem you're going to help the
4263.6,ecosystem flourish by your existence not
4266.679,threaten
4269.56,it and so telling your story is not
4272.6,actually your story and the other thing
4275.199,I should put in here but it was too many
4276.48,words I thought for this have other
4278.44,people tell your
4281.32,story so hopefully you know some people
4284.04,coming to that organization but if not
4286.64,find some quick allies and give them a
4289.199,story that they can tell it's most
4292.12,impactful not when you tell it but when
4293.6,someone tells it when you're not in the
4294.719,room you're not going to be in a lot of
4295.8,rooms in the
4296.96,beginning oh who's that that's the new
4299.36,director of XNX that's a new role to do
4301.4,Innovation and this they're going to do
4303.04,this this person hired them just a real
4305.92,quick and easy because what are people
4307.96,trying to do what are you trying to do
4309.12,when someone new comes in where do you
4310.32,fit in what are you whose team are you
4312.6,on are you going to help me should I be
4314.56,working with you
4316.48,are you going to be working for me are
4318.84,we going to competing for the same
4320.96,things those are all the questions
4322.719,people are tilting around in their head
4324.32,so if you give them a quick like you are
4326.56,here
4328.44,dot that's very helpful two other things
4331.4,about telling your story again hard
4337.4,lessons it's very very difficult to
4340.52,explain from a security perspective
4345.32,why the absence of something is a
4348.32,problem or an intelligence
4351.239,perspective I've worked in organizations
4354.12,in one organization I was there to help
4356.96,thread together strands in geopolitical
4359.239,Risk terrorism fraud cyber
4362.48,investigations and this organization had
4364.96,whole teams dedicated to fraud and whole
4368.44,teams dedicated to investigations of
4371.48,which there were cyber
4373.4,investigations and terrorism was was
4375.719,everywhere in the headlines the board
4377.88,was talking about it Executives were
4379.639,concerned about it and geopolitical risk
4381.28,is very hard for people to get their
4383.199,heads
4384.36,around but people were making decisions
4386.56,based on all of those
4390.4,things so when I say tell a story I
4393.719,don't mean make some [ __ ]
4395.6,up I mean figure out what you're there
4398.12,to
4400.199,do so in that case
4405.76,adversaries our
4409.0,adversaries were exploiting each of
4411.199,those
4412.36,seams and this organization was dealing
4414.8,with them as they came
4416.96,in and in dealing with those silos there
4419.96,were
4421.32,seams my team's job was to close
4426.0,those find the blind spots because the
4429.239,way you look at analyze mitigate fraud
4432.679,very different than the way you think
4434.32,about cyber crime investigations know
4437.76,large financial institution they
4439.8,shouldn't be all of you were like what
4442.36,yep but they
4444.44,are and
4447.0,terrorism people didn't really care
4449.28,about fraud it's not particularly sexy
4452.0,terrorism oh my goodness okay what yes
4454.12,what do we need to do we have to connect
4455.84,those two because the adversaries
4457.719,definitely work we using credit card
4459.639,fraud to fund this was really fast and
4463.44,guess what they were doing on the dark
4464.8,web cyber crime like there was the there
4468.04,was the arc and it felt very
4470.56,clear but being able to tell that people
4472.92,are like oh okay got
4476.28,it and it it's not like that popped up
4479.56,immediately I took time to earn towards
4482.639,that so I'm going to talk about two or
4485.28,three other things and then I really
4486.639,want to get some questions and
4488.199,conversation going
4492.12,here in another one of my roles
4499.04,I knew that it didn't exist before and I
4500.88,knew that I was going to be met with
4504.56,resistance this is another tenant
4508.0,everybody can and will tell you what
4510.48,wrong looks like but nobody can tell you
4512.88,what right looks
4514.76,like everybody's going to like that
4516.639,doesn't work tried
4518.8,that that's not going to work we tried
4521.52,that before that doesn't work here
4526.4,and so then your natural thing would be
4527.679,like oh cool what does work then back I
4529.36,don't
4530.08,know isn't that why you're here pirate
4534.199,unicorn so it took me the fifth time to
4538.76,figure out how to deal with this because
4540.199,I dealt with this like defensively I
4542.04,tried to persuade people
4545.52,um I try to convince them early on but
4548.04,look at my plan look at this beautiful
4549.8,PowerPoint I've
4551.08,built how about I come in and tell you
4553.44,about what this thing is
4555.679,I started an organization I was working
4557.44,on critical infrastructure most people
4559.08,at the organization did not know what
4560.639,critical infrastructure does was like
4563.28,well I'm GNA go on a like tour I'll come
4565.639,in and talk to you about critical
4567.6,infrastructure here's critical
4570.96,infrastructure and they were like that
4573.12,seems like a waste of time like I don't
4575.8,know what it is why is it
4578.96,important so my sincere advice is when
4582.719,you find yourself in a place where you
4584.92,you think you're going to hear or you
4586.28,start to hear nope that's not going to
4588.08,work can't do that we've tried that
4589.719,before get aggressively
4593.199,curious ask people okay tell me why what
4597.159,have you tried when did you try
4600.32,it and how did that work what did you
4603.08,learn push them two things are going to
4606.239,happen one a lot of people aren't going
4608.0,to actually have things that they tried
4609.239,it's just a
4610.28,feeling a perception and now you get to
4613.36,press that two you're going to find some
4618.159,people you know this most of the people
4620.48,who are the doers they're not the ones
4622.04,who are naysayers they're like yeah I
4623.96,Tred that didn't work so eventually I
4625.56,find the like doer who actually tried
4627.32,the thing oh yeah we couldn't do it
4629.6,because um this thing this sort of
4631.28,budgetary thing was there this thing we
4633.04,had this technical hang up oh well is
4635.32,that still here because we moved this I
4637.04,don't know I moved on to other projects
4639.52,wait a minute what it might actually
4642.719,work so
4645.4,you can build on other people's I won't
4647.52,even say failures previous
4651.28,tries that's how I found success and I
4654.12,did y'all I did I found
4656.679,success and I was always very open that
4660.159,it was like oh no I didn't come up with
4662.36,all this this was built on what that
4664.159,person did five years ago before this
4668.159,whole thing was even conceived
4670.159,of this was built on this they tried
4672.48,this two quarters ago but the budget
4674.199,wasn't there or I wasn't
4676.719,here or we just had that
4680.52,incident now we know how that's actually
4682.48,going to
4684.639,go so when everyone tells you what wrong
4687.719,looks like and no one can tell you what
4689.32,right looks like get aggressively
4691.8,curious ask them what did you try how
4695.04,did you try it what did you learn figure
4697.639,out what assumptions they made see if
4699.32,you can take on those assumptions or
4700.88,test them again like seriously get
4702.719,scientific
4705.52,and then you can figure out if their
4706.8,experience their anecdotes their Insight
4709.12,their case studies their proof of
4710.8,concept can be used
4712.8,again there's a really good chance that
4714.96,it can there's a really good chance that
4717.08,it
4719.239,can so last couple things before I close
4723.8,with you know hopefully giving you
4725.96,something to really really sink into so
4729.6,find the sponsor identify recruit bles I
4731.8,think I talked about the sponsor before
4734.04,who brought it in
4736.44,in multiparty
4737.88,negotiation um you will hear the term in
4741.52,business stakeholder stakeholder
4742.88,management stakeholder is really generic
4745.12,there lots of different kinds of
4746.719,stakeholders so when you're designing
4749.679,top multiparty negotiation that strategy
4752.92,you map out the players you put them in
4755.639,three categories allies adversaries
4758.56,recres it's funny because in cyber we
4760.88,just think
4763.719,adversaries we don't often think about
4766.639,allies think about our team maybe not
4769.679,like allies allies adversaries
4773.4,recruitable so adversaries I don't need
4775.76,to tell you who those are how do I
4778.4,identify them allies I'm not going to
4780.36,spend time on them so I think you
4782.8,probably have a sense
4786.239,recruiters so in one of my
4789.08,roles I did my best in all the early
4792.0,listening you got to know this team this
4793.719,team this team who did people whine
4795.48,about on my
4797.32,team and who did I think whin about our
4799.88,team or didn't like our
4802.8,team and who did we need that
4806.76,intersection are the
4809.44,recruitable who can you bring
4812.12,over so this is
4814.36,delicate it's why it's later
4816.88,here I would argue if you aren't like a
4820.159,seasoned Navigator of organizational
4822.48,politics this is a good time to lean on
4825.4,your mentors and advisers but in that
4827.36,new role you're going to need to learn
4829.0,how to do this and then this is to go
4832.32,talk to the
4835.28,recres and potentially recruit them
4839.32,there is one organization I was at I
4840.88,came up with a stakeholder map and
4842.28,without labeling them recruit bles I
4844.28,just put a question mark in that column
4847.159,I showed it to my
4849.32,boss and like that whole column he had
4852.88,the same reaction he was like they don't
4855.32,like us I like hm do you think they talk
4858.56,to me I don't know you're
4861.719,new cool are you okay if I go talk to
4864.159,them can't
4866.199,hurt so I
4868.56,did and you know what I said hey I'm new
4871.639,here it's the best opener you ever moved
4875.12,to a new
4876.12,town New City new place come to a new
4880.159,conference how many of you is first time
4882.08,at
4882.8,bsides cool oh my my gosh amazing
4887.88,welcome you're sitting standing next to
4890.159,somebody easy it's my first conference
4893.08,have you been here
4894.28,before what are they going to say yes
4897.719,cool me too no great what should I
4903.32,know I did the same thing I'm new here
4906.719,surprise surprise sometimes people be
4908.239,like me
4909.199,too oh good so you don't have the world
4912.84,organizational [ __ ] and neither do I
4915.12,and if they weren't I would say tell me
4916.6,what I should know about my
4919.04,team most people were surprised by that
4922.4,they thought I was coming over to like
4924.08,prove something I'm part of the new
4926.8,team and the new role too I said no I
4929.32,have a new role remember I told you was
4930.8,very open about it new role just created
4933.28,and on that team what should I know
4935.04,about it what's the history between our
4937.32,teams
4939.08,woo now it's your turn can you be candid
4942.92,because if you person who I'm talking to
4945.04,don't take this opportunity to try and
4946.88,repair and mend these relationships that
4948.88,is now on
4950.199,you so that you don't know what you
4952.28,don't know I put that back on them I
4954.0,don't know what I should know help me
4955.8,understand it's us against the
4957.199,adversaries so what should I
4962.44,know so this goes back to the customers
4964.8,and stakeholders who's going to gain
4966.84,from this new role you might be
4969.4,surprised it's not going to be people
4970.92,necessarily in the immediate
4972.639,orbit for example there's one I came in
4976.08,and I was going to be speaking to the
4977.4,media and Industry and whatever else and
4980.199,no one had linked me up with the
4981.44,marketing people but I wanted the
4982.48,marketing people they're like what
4983.88,you're here great awesome can we talk to
4986.32,you can you help us and I was like yes
4987.8,help me understand this and but no one
4990.28,had thought to make that link no
4991.84,indictment of the organization but it
4993.679,just no one knew really what this role
4995.56,was going to be so they didn't know who
4996.6,was going to gain from it and then
4999.239,occasionally and it's a really wonderful
5001.239,thing you will find people who have been
5003.0,waiting for you
5006.6,and sometimes you might be that person
5008.36,and a new rule comes in and you'll be
5009.8,like we've been waiting for
5011.76,you here's a stack of work and also can
5014.92,you help with this and oh you have that
5016.36,skill
5018.28,set oh great we've been waiting for
5022.8,you and then the last
5026.04,one ask this
5028.76,question and listen with
5031.48,empathy because if you listen
5034.56,with your hackles raised then you will
5036.96,become an invasive
5038.719,species who wants and needs you to
5042.96,fail who needs you to fail in this new
5047.76,role it does not mean they're going to
5050.36,try and get you to
5054.0,fail but understanding
5056.48,that that's a potential
5059.199,recruitable and as well it will tell you
5061.52,a ton about organizational Dynamics
5064.88,maybe that person used to be a pirate
5068.12,unicorn and they got this has happened I
5070.56,don't know why I'm saying
5074.52,maybe I sensed some part of the
5078.159,environment just
5079.76,like focus on me kind of like this I was
5084.36,like hey hey like that's how I felt like
5087.48,I was greeted all the time or and people
5090.239,would say their name be like this person
5093.76,oh [ __ ]
5096.96,and I
5098.08,learned again aggressive curiosity
5100.52,empathy
5101.6,humility that that person used to be a
5103.76,pirate
5105.04,unicorn and it didn't
5107.119,work so they got put into this box
5111.679,man so
5114.48,they
5116.0,didn't want me to
5119.08,succeed because if I succeeded then what
5121.56,did that mean about them not about the
5123.92,organization in the existence of pirate
5127.04,unicorns man what a humbling moment that
5130.199,was when I had that
5132.199,realization and it was months and I say
5135.36,months because maybe months isn't a long
5136.76,time but in this case it was a long time
5138.28,before I could talk to them about it
5140.04,because it was disclosed to me not in
5141.6,the best
5143.4,way finally had the
5145.639,opportunity and then that person became
5148.6,such a huge
5149.92,supporter guests who opened up their
5152.199,book of lessons and an does and proof of
5155.76,Concepts and
5158.92,relationships and we became like a great
5163.28,teammate so I asked that question not to
5166.119,say spot the snipers who wants and needs
5169.04,you to
5170.159,fail but it will tell you a lot about
5172.199,organizational dynamics that had nothing
5173.76,to do with that individual and
5174.96,everything to do about the environment
5176.36,that we were in okay so last thing I've
5179.199,heaped a bunch of things on you some
5182.679,questions thanks Manisha kind of
5185.28,helpful I give you some very tactical
5187.44,advice and I have given this to many
5191.6,many people I take it
5193.199,myself one of the most crucial things in
5196.52,the new
5197.679,rule is figuring out what success is
5200.08,going to look
5202.76,like some organizations are terrible at
5206.88,defining
5209.56,success I don't mean just having
5212.4,kpis I mean measuring
5215.119,progress and again if it hasn't been
5217.239,done before how do we figure that
5220.4,out so here's the good news there's a
5224.32,lot of pirate unicorns out there awesome
5226.199,if you're just walking this talk and
5227.159,hearing about pirate unicorns come on in
5229.44,there's a lot of pirate unicorns out
5230.84,there
5233.88,and you don't have to reinvent that so
5237.84,there's a book that I recommend to just
5239.56,about everybody I read it myself when I
5242.0,start a new job it's called The First 90
5243.679,days
5245.36,and the focus of this is there's
5247.52,different models of what kind of role
5249.52,you're coming into startup a turnaround
5252.6,accelerator realignment sustaining
5255.6,success it's about diagnosing what
5258.159,you're coming
5259.28,into and building a learning agenda for
5261.92,your first 90 days now this book one
5264.56,caveat don't read it cover to cover it's
5266.76,a guide book it's a Choose Your Own
5268.28,Adventure sometimes you're going to come
5269.719,up it's going to be one kind of thing
5271.0,you're going to focus on that another
5272.679,time I have reread reread this book
5274.88,every time I start a new role and if
5276.679,you're a mentor by the way and you have
5278.679,proteges this is a great gift when they
5281.119,get that job here read this book A lot
5284.639,of the things I've talked about are
5286.52,captured in here not everything because
5288.92,it's not all the Nuance of the new role
5290.679,the stuff I was sharing with you but a
5292.679,lot of it is captured in here otherwise
5294.6,I would have had to come up with this
5295.52,whole rubric but a lot of what I figured
5297.639,out and how to put together when I found
5298.92,this book I was like oh yes I tried that
5300.4,but that's way better oh I did that but
5301.88,that's back by research oh I did that
5303.36,but here's a Pro an example in
5305.88,business not just security so I realize
5309.639,I am right up on time and I didn't leave
5311.6,room for any
5312.8,questions all we have a few minutes
5315.08,right for questions two three
5318.239,great sorry I meant to leave so much
5320.36,more time thank
5323.119,you pirate
5329.679,unicorns okay cool if you have questions
5332.119,put your hands up I'm going to take a
5333.119,few at a time maybe we can put
5335.6,together yes
5340.719,question say that again what if you're
5343.28,not
5344.679,the rest got it what if you're not new
5347.639,to the role and trying to restart things
5349.159,other question
5357.639,yeah oh
5359.639,good okay so you're hiring a pirate
5362.44,unicorn all right so so restart and then
5365.36,hiring a pirate unicorn one other
5366.679,question
5374.56,yeah like a new initiative kind
5381.76,of yeah I'm going to repeat back the
5383.679,question that's say it
5388.04,again
5390.0,yes got
5392.56,it got it okay okay so trying to create
5395.48,trying to create space for a pirate
5396.639,unicorn you've hired a pirate unicorn
5398.48,now how do you have them succeed and
5400.56,you're trying to restart something it's
5402.28,not necessarily a new
5403.8,role I would
5407.52,say okay I would say treat it like a new
5411.08,role you're going to find some people
5413.96,who are there but that same skepticism
5416.0,is going to be there I mean tilt heavier
5418.04,on the see you as an invasive species
5420.199,and a predator that's what I would say
5423.0,but all the things I put up there in
5424.56,terms of or talked about in terms of
5426.6,like curiosity and humility I think are
5429.08,really important
5431.159,um I would share the knowledge that you
5434.239,have that this is not new I understood
5436.56,that someone has tried to do this before
5439.04,what do you think are some of the key
5440.44,lessons that they learned or they should
5442.08,have learned or what do you wish they
5443.92,did
5444.76,earlier you know like come to the
5447.04,organization come to people with that in
5449.159,terms of yourself try and get all the
5451.119,materials anything what list were they
5453.679,on whose team were they on what function
5455.44,did they report to cuz as much as you
5457.96,can understand about that previous role
5460.8,you can then calibrate the lessons that
5463.119,you get from them that makes sense um
5465.92,these two so how do you set up someone
5468.159,for Success when you come in and how do
5469.76,you what are the next steps if you
5471.159,identify that there's a Nexus of those
5474.44,needs so these two are connected figure
5477.52,out what the story
5479.239,is timing timing timing timing is key
5483.28,figure out what the story story is and
5484.92,find people who are going to be there
5486.52,advocating for that person when they
5488.119,come in so it's the sponsor 100%
5491.36,someone's going to need to put down
5493.04,we're in Vegas someone's got to bankroll
5494.679,you someone's got to put down that
5496.44,political capital and that
5497.4,organizational Capital but then you need
5499.239,a bunch of people around who're going to
5500.8,advocate for them get them into rooms be
5502.719,prepared to partner with
5505.88,them and be ready to to hear the the
5509.8,kind of story so that when they come in
5511.44,they don't have to do a lot of that
5512.84,communication oh yeah I heard about your
5514.719,role you're going to be doing this
5516.199,you're on this
5517.28,team so it sounds weird but minimize as
5519.92,much of the newness as
5521.8,possible because then people are like
5523.6,okay the rule is new but that idea has
5526.119,been here or oh gez the senior person
5529.36,said they they from their standpoint
5531.679,they see a real pain point or we had
5533.32,this incident this thing happened people
5535.88,don't know that people don't know that's
5537.56,what triggered this we had an audit
5540.04,we're under consent decree crowd strike
5543.48,whatever it
5545.119,is cool I want to be respectful of time
5547.84,I'm happy to answer some more questions
5549.679,I'm going to I one more question okay I
5552.679,can take one more question you got a
5554.199,burning one otherwise oh yeah right here
5557.08,not really com I've been consult
5584.6,thank you I I'll just repeat briefly
5586.52,although it's a compliment I that means
5589.0,a lot uh person here as a consultant and
5591.8,said I do this kind of stuff every six
5593.92,months nine months and it could be used
5595.96,not just in a new role a new initiative
5597.56,just asking those questions and coming
5598.88,to the organization are very fruitful um
5601.36,I'm going to grab a mask and then
5602.96,Christen sh I'll just step right outside
5605.239,over there happy to answer any questions
5607.6,quick plug at 3:00 today I'm going to be
